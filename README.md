## ‚úÖ Key Functionalities Implemented
- Product Listing
- Displays a list of products fetched from DummyJSON.
- Supports pagination with dynamic page controls.
- Filters products by search keyword and category.
- Add Product
- Form with validation using Zod (required fields, non-negative numbers, etc.).
- Availability dropdown: ‚ÄúIn Stock‚Äù, ‚ÄúLow Stock‚Äù, ‚ÄúOut of Stock‚Äù.
- Conditional logic for availability based on stock count.
- Successfully added product is appended to the local state on the current page.
- Pagination
- Calculates totalPages based on API's total count.
- Uses React Query to refetch data based on page changes.
- Keeps previous data cached for smoother transitions.

## üß† Thought Process & Considerations
- Scalability: Hook-based architecture and global stores enable easy scaling of features like filtering, bulk actions, or sorting.
- Performance: React Query caching and keepPreviousData ensure optimized API usage and smoother UX.
- Validation UX: Zod helps enforce strong validation rules while keeping the code declarative and readable.
- Modularity: Clean separation of concerns through features, pages, hooks, and stores.
